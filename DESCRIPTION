Description: A header only library integrating 'testthat' with 'trompeoeil' to
    provide mocking for C++ code in R packages. Mocking is a technique for
    making a fake version of a software service. You can mock services to
    test that your code interacts correctly with external interfaces, to make
    your tests deterministic, or to break your tests down into smaller units.
    'testthat' provides a testing framework for R and C++ code in R packages.
    'trompeoeil' is a C++ header only library for mocking.
